   abstract = {By the virtues of the Dyson–Schwinger equations, we upgrade the published code HELAC to be capable to calculate the heavy quarkonium helicity amplitudes in the framework of NRQCD factorization, which we dub HELAC-Onia. We rewrote the original HELAC to make the new program be able to calculate helicity amplitudes of multi P-wave quarkonium states production at hadron colliders and electron–positron colliders by including new P-wave off-shell currents. Therefore, besides the high efficiencies in computation of multi-leg processes within the Standard Model, HELAC-Onia is also sufficiently numerical stable in dealing with P-wave quarkonia (e.g. hc,b,χc,b) and P-wave color-octet intermediate states. To the best of our knowledge, it is a first general-purpose automatic quarkonium matrix elements generator based on recursion relations on the market. Program summary Program title:   HELAC-Onia.

Computer:  Any. Operating system:  Windows, Unix. Classification:  4.4, 11.1, 11.2, 11.5. Nature of problem: An important way to explore the law of the nature is to investigate the heavy quarkonium physics at B factories and hadron colliders. However, its production mechanism is still unclear, though NRQCD can explain its decay mechanism in a sufficiently satisfactory manner. The substantial K-factor in heavy quarkonium production processes also implies that the associated production of quarkonium and a relatively large number of particles may play a crucial role in unveiling its production mechanism. Solution method: A labor-saving and efficient way is to make the tedious amplitudes calculation automatic. Based on a recursive algorithm derived from the Dyson–Schwinger equations, the goal of automatic calculation of heavy quarkonium helicity amplitudes in NRQCD has been achieved. Inheriting from the virtues of the recursion relations with the lower computational cost compared to the traditional Feynman-diagram based method, the multi-leg processes (with or without multi-quarkonia up to P-wave states) at colliders are also accessible. Running time: It depends on the process that is to be calculated. However, typically, for all of the tested processes, they take from several minutes to tens of minutes.},

   abstract = {We present an upgraded version (denoted as version 2.0) of the program HELAC-Onia  for the automated computation of heavy-quarkonium helicity amplitudes within non-relativistic QCD framework. The new code has been designed to include many new and useful features for practical phenomenological simulations. It is designed for job submissions under cluster environment for parallel computations via Python  scripts. We have interfaced HELAC-Onia  to the parton shower Monte Carlo programs Pythia  8 and QEDPS  to take into account the parton-shower effects. Moreover, the decay module guarantees that the program can perform the spin-entangled (cascade-)decay of heavy quarkonium after its generation. We have also implemented a reweighting method to automatically estimate the uncertainties from renormalization and/or factorization scales as well as parton-distribution functions to weighted or unweighted events. A further update is the possibility to generate one-dimensional or two-dimensional plots encoded in the analysis files on the fly. Some dedicated examples are given at the end of the writeup.

Comm. 184(2013)2562 External routines: LHAPDF Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Heavy quarkonium production processes provide an important way to investigate QCD in its poorly known non-perturbative regime. Its production mechanism has attracted extensive interests from the high-energy physics community in decades. The qualitative and quantitative description of heavy-quarkonium production requires complex perturbative computations for high-multiplicity processes in the framework of the well established non-relativistic effective theory, NRQCD, and reliable Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce the collider environment. Solution method: Based on a recursion relation, the program is able to calculate the helicity amplitudes of the high-multiplicity heavy- quarkonium-production processes. Several modules are also designed for dedicated simulations: 1.The code has been interfaced with the parton shower Monte Carlo programs;2.A decay module to let heavy quarkonia decay with correct spin-correlations has been implemented;3.The code estimates the theoretical uncertainties and analyzes the generated events on the fly;4.The code is compliant with multi-threading/multi-core usage or cluster processors. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded functionalities. Summary of revisions: Many new features were added and several important bugs were fixed. The new features extend the range of the physical applications. With the new interface, it also helps to improve the user-friendliness of the program. Running time: It depends on the process to be calculated and the required accuracy.},

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: ACTU_v3_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 852 Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models. Summary of revisions: Hundreds of new features and bug fixes, allowing improved modelling. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10–1000 events per second, depending on process studied.},

   abstract = {Protons consist of three valence quarks, two up-quarks and one down-quark, held together by gluons and a sea of quark-antiquark pairs. Collectively, quarks and gluons are referred to as partons. In a proton-proton collision, typically only one parton of each proton undergoes a hard scattering – referred to as single-parton scattering – leaving the remainder of each proton only slightly disturbed. Here, we report the study of double- and triple-parton scatterings through the simultaneous production of three J/ψ mesons, which consist of a charm quark-antiquark pair, in proton-proton collisions recorded with the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. We observed this process – reconstructed through the decays of J/ψ mesons into pairs of oppositely charged muons – with a statistical significance above five standard deviations. We measured the inclusive fiducial cross-section to be $$27{2}_{-104}^{+141}\,{{{\rm{(stat)}}}}\,\pm 17\,{{{\rm{(syst)}}}}\,{{{\rm{fb}}}}\,$$, and compared it to theoretical expectations for triple-J/ψ meson production in single-, double- and triple-parton scattering scenarios. Assuming factorization of multiple hard-scattering probabilities in terms of single-parton scattering cross-sections, double- and triple-parton scattering are the dominant contributions for the measured process.},

    abstract = { We derive expressions for the cross-section of the multiparton interactions (MPI) based on the analysis of the relevant Feynman diagrams. We express the MPI cross-sections through the double (triple,…) generalized parton distributions (GPDs). In the mean field approximation for the double GPDs, the answer for the double parton cross-section is expressed through the integral over two gluon.nucleon form factor which was measured in the exclusive DIS vector meson production. We explain under what conditions the derived expressions for MPI correspond to an intuitive picture of hard interactions in the impact parameter representation. The mean field approximation in which correlations of the partons are neglected fails to explain the double parton interaction data. Perturbative- QCD-induced correlations enhance the cross-section by a factor of 1.5–2 for large p⊥ and 0.001 < x < 0.1 explaining the current data. We argue that in the small x kinematics (10−4 ≤ x ≤ 10−3) where effects of perturbative correlations diminish, a diffractive nonperturbative mechanism kicks in and generates positive correlations comparable in magnitude with perturbative ones. We explain how our technique can be used for calculations of MPI in the proton-nucleus scattering. The interplay of hard interactions and underlying event is discussed, as well as different geometric pictures for each of the MPI mechanisms — pQCD, nonperturbative correlations and mean field. Predictions for value of σeff for various processes and a wide range of kinematics are given. We show that together different MPI mechanisms give good description of experimental data, both at Tevatron, and LHC, including the central kinematics studied by ATLAS and CMS detectors, and forward (heavy flavors) kinematics studied by LHCb. }

SketchUp provides a Ruby API which we use to interface with the CMS Detector Description to create 3D models of the CMS detector. With the Ruby API, we also have created an interface to the JSON-based event format used for the iSpy event display to create 3D models of CMS events. These models have many applications related to 3D representation of the CMS detector and events. Figures produced based on these models were used in conference presentations, journal publications, technical design reports for the detector upgrades, art projects, outreach programs, and other presentations.}

abstract="The CMS experiment at CERN uses a two-stage trigger system to filter and store events of physics importance a hardware-based Level 1 (L1) trigger that uses fast electronics to process data in a pipeline fashion at 40 MHz with an output rate of 100 kHz and a software-based High-Level Trigger (HLT), run on computer farms with an output rate of around 1.5 kHz. Many novel trigger algorithms, coupled with technological developments such as heterogeneous computing in GPUs were developed to cope with the increased luminosity and physics needs of Run 3. This poster summarises the performance of HLT for Run 3.",
